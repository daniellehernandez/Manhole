MANHOLE! is a game derived from the Japanese game of [Brain Wall](https://youtu.be/zL4HSk4MUUw) (aka Human Tetris or Hole in the Wall) . It is a one-player game in which moving 'walls' having a certain shape or posture of a human has to be imitated by the player. With the use of certain keyboard combinations (pressed or long-pressed, if possible), the player can toggle the movements of the arms and legs. Failure to follow the hole in the wall will result to game over.
